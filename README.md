# CAL React
This is the beginning of a redo of my personal portfolio site as a static react app written in typescript.

There are several goals here:
* accessibility: maintain at least WCAG AA compliance
* use nascent dark mode features
* Do I really need a BE for a simple portfolio site? I think no, probably. Or if I do, I can probably handle it with a more lightweight BE service hosted on glitch or similar, somewhere other than the FE code. This would also save me some DigitalOcean costs.

## Create react app stuff

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
